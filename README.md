## Application ([Facebook clone]).

Build Facebook! You’ll build a large portion of the core Facebook user functionality in this project. We won’t be worrying about the Javascript-heavy front end stuff but you won’t need it to get a nice user experience.

This is a microverse project. Click to know more about [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/).

## Getting started with ruby on rails?

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:
$ bundle install 

Next, migrate the database:
$ rails db:migrate

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:
$ rails test

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:
$ rails server
